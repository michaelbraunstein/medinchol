Correctly complete the following assignment.  Follow all directions.  The main purpose is to show super and sub class relationships with an array of super media pointers to sub class objects and dynamic binding.  The < operator will be overloaded in the super class so all subclasses can use it.  The selection sort method will be in the main .cpp file because it will sort the array created in main.  The final .cpp file, the three .h header class files, and a separate output .txt text file (copied and pasted from the console screen) should be submitted.

The selection sort function for an array of cstrings from chapter 3 notes is also attached with some hints on how to adjust that function to a selection sort function for an array of super media pointers.

Hint: Good Guides:  5-12b inheritance with super pointer array including virtual function, 5-10 operator overload, attached selection sort function.
